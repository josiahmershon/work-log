### Summary

Integrated Chainlit login flow (ENABLE_AUTH flag): prompts for credentials, stores JWT, and relays it on every request.
Added automatic server-side chat session handling from the frontend (create on start, append messages per turn).
Updated frontend and root READMEs with the new auth-dependent setup, env instructions, and user-facing flow.
Synced Docker env files with AD placeholders; confirmed stub-mode behaviour manually via curl tests.
