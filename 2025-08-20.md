### Summary

Followed up on the final diagnosis of a firmware incompatibility with all tested Ubuntu Server installers (22.04, 24.04.2, 24.04.3).

Coordinated with Mark for physical server access. Initial plan to deploy Fedora 42 installer.
- Hypothesis: Ubuntu installers incompatible with server firmware.
- Fedora boot attempt failed. Anaconda installer crashed on both GUI and text mode.
- Recalled physical monitor connected to A6000 DisplayPort. Mark unplugged the cable.
- New Hypothesis: nouveau driver crashing due to DP output.
- Re-attempted boot from existing internal Ubuntu OS. SUCCESS. Booted past EFI stub hang.
- Root Cause Confirmed: Physical monitor presence was blocking kernel load.
- Post-boot, diagnosed nvidia-smi failure. Driver not loaded.
- Began driver repair sequence:
  - ubuntu-drivers autoinstall failed. apt dependency conflicts.
  - Purged all nvidia packages.
  - autoinstall failed again. apt 404 error on package fetch.
  - apt update, then autoinstall. Ran but did not resolve issue after reboot.
  - mokutil confirmed Secure Boot disabled. Not the cause.
  - dkms status returned command not found. dkms package missing.
  - Installed dkms and linux-headers-$(uname -r)
  - Re-ran autoinstall. Rebooted.
- SUCCESS: nvidia-smi now functional.
- Post-driver fix, diagnosed total network failure. No ping/SSH.
  - ip a showed no static IP. netplan apply failed, MAC mismatch error.
  - Found and corrected single-character typo in /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml MAC address.
  - netplan apply now succeeds. IP is assigned.
  - Still no connectivity. ping 10.100.175.1 fails. arp -n shows (incomplete).
- Diagnosis: Layer 2 issue. Server config is correct. Problem is external.
- Handed off to Mark to investigate switch port and cable. 
- not a cable issue. Likely switchport. Mark is investigating. 

Overall, this is a satisfactory outcome. This is a lot easier to deal with.
