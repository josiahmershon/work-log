### Summary

I looked into how we can use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expand our platform. I checked out different tools we could connect to, like Outlook, Google Workspace, Slack, and our Oracle databases, and wrote down what we'd need for logins and setup. I decided to prioritize Calendar and our internal databases because they're the most useful right now and the easiest to get started with.
