### Summary

Successfully deployed the project's core database foundation using Docker Compose, consisting of PostgreSQL and the pgvector extension.

Verified the stack by connecting to the database instance and enabling the vector extension, confirming the environment is fully operational and ready for schema creation.

Started working on the initial CREATE TABLE statement for the vector_index based on the blueprint's required metadata fields.

Identified a dependency on the final specification for the doc_id field (e.g., GUID vs. deterministic composite) and paused schema creation to avoid rework.

Next action is to sync with John Gibbs to finalize the identifier strategy before committing to the table schema.

Talked to John on the phone regarding next steps. Finalized some birds-eye plans and synchronized on the project idea.
