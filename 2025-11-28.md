### Summary

docs: Update README and environment configuration for improved setup instructions

- Clarified backend/frontend setup steps in README, including copying env templates before running locally or via Docker Compose.
- Added chat-history and response-source options to backend/env.example; introduced frontend/env.example with history and attachment defaults.
- Documented the chat experience (per-session history, transient attachments, trimmed citations) and noted the new Chainlit status messages.
- Migrated FastAPI startup/shutdown to lifespan handlers and aligned compose env files so backend credentials match the postgres container.

Next week: focus on frontend overhaul—wire in real auth, move from per-session to persisted chat history, polish attachment UX, and explore cross-session memory.
