### Summary

Built shared logging module with JSON/console formatters; swapped every backend script/app to use it so env-driven log level/format works end-to-end.
Hardened settings loader: moved credentials into SecretStr, added env aliases and validators, and normalized embedding/vector helpers across ingestion, Oracle feed, and maintenance scripts.
Reworked FastAPI startup to support TEST_MODE stubs for embeddings, DB, and vLLM; produced deterministic responses and a lightweight smoke-test suite hitting /health, /query, and /query-lc.
Updated env template plus CLI tools to align with the new configuration model; noted follow-up docs work.
