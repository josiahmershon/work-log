## Work Log Entry: 2025-08-26

Clock in: 10:00 a.m.
Clock out: 4:15 p.m.

### Summary

Cable has been replaced, more experimentation with ethtool and dmesg kernel logs to identify fault. All looks perfect on the surface, making this a very difficult to identify issue. 

Issue persisted. 10GbE NIC still connecting at 1Gbps with no Layer 2 connectivity (ARP failure).

Ruled out the physical cable as the root cause.

Tomorrow I will complete a full network stack reset.
