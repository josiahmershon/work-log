### Summary

I refined and tested all AI assistant workflows end-to-end. I validated sales assistant routing (product info, pricing, inventory, promotions, processes), general assistant capabilities (web search, weather, email drafting), and IT ticket submission system. I optimized response quality and error handling across all branches. The platform is ready for pilot user deployment, with caveats for various documented previously and mostly out of my control.
