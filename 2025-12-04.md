### Summary

Implemented /auth/login endpoint using the new AD helper and JWT issuing.
Wrapped all RAG endpoints with JWT auth; user groups now default from the token, and test mode stubs mimic AD behavior.
Locked down chat-session APIs to respect authenticated user scope and auto-create tables.
Extended smoke tests to log in, hit the RAG endpoints, and exercise session persistence under stubs.
