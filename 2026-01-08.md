### Summary

Set up a system for the sales assistant to look up process documents. I added the 2026 Convenience Store Incentive Program files and improved the search so it finds the right info easily. After testing, the assistant can now accurately explain program rules and deadlines, in addition to handling product info, pricing, and inventory.
