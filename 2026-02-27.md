### Summary

Debated feasibility of Claude models for API inference due to the Department of War's designation of Claude as a national security risk. Likely will stick with Gemini for now; at least until enough GPU's are available for local inference. Sketched out plan for knowledge base structure to aid in IT support before ticket creation is necessary, as now that UPC project is wrapping up, data ingestion can begin with the new, correct data. Will coordinate with John on this next week. Spent a long time troubleshooting a persistent issue with openclaw ticket submission skill and eventually fixed it.
