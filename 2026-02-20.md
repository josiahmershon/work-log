### Summary

Was not able to make it into office today. All home servers went down due to power surge and was busy in the morning fixing. Managed to get some high level planning done for the local deployments. Mainly brainstorming how to fix the SysAid API issues. Seems to be mainly due to their API not being as robust as I expected. Again, tickets still submit and work, just missing some fields. 
Still need to brainstorm how to safeguard the OpenClaw agents from being used for malicious purposes or autonomously creating skills / actions for themselves that could be harmful. 
Will try to make it in office next week.
