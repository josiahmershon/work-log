### Summary

Today I integrated the SysAid API with the IT ticket submission workflow. I implemented the authentication, ticket creation, and error handling components. I also developed a proof of concept that gathers user issue details conversationally and automatically creates formatted tickets in SysAid, returning a confirmation ID to the user. This establishes the foundation for including additional fields such as priority routing as requirements are defined.
