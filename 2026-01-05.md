### Summary

I researched how to connect our IT ticket system to the SysAid REST API. I looked at how to log in, which endpoints to use, and what information is needed to create a ticket. I found that we'll need admin access and a way to handle session IDs. I also wrote down the API's limits and our plan for the integration.
