### Summary

Finished vuln report with the help of Claude. It is available to anyone who would like to see it. The only calls to action in the report are to update the version, run a built-in security audit, verify a few things, disable unused tools, and some other basic housekeeping. I will be able to start implementing these effectively and crafting what will be final deployment package for the beta users on Friday if I make it into the office, which is likely. 

I'm feeling good about the project.
