### Summary

Today I completely fleshed out the web search tool. It now uses the intent classifier to determine if it should use web search, and if so, it uses the web search tool to get the answer. The web search tool I am using is the Brave API, and it retrieves up to 10 results which provides context for the LLM to generate a response. I also wrote an extensive system prompt to ensure the LLM provides accurate and concise responses. 
Tomorrow I will build the weather search tool, and then the email drafting tool and general query tool on Friday.
