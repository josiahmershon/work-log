### Summary

Completed a deep-dive analysis of the "On-Premises AI Assistant Deployment Blueprint" to internalize the technical architecture and phased implementation plan.

Mapped out the initial technical tasks for Phase 0 - Foundations, focusing on establishing the core data foundation (PostgreSQL + pgvector) before tackling the orchestration layer.

Began preliminary research into the new-to-me technologies specified in the blueprint, specifically the Docker deployment of PostgreSQL and the process for enabling the pgvector extension.

Outlined a concrete plan for the week: deploy the database, establish a basic backend service with LangChain, and then validate the core permission-filtering logic against a test dataset. Ideally at least the database deployment will occur this week. 

Set the immediate objective for tomorrow: deploy the PostgreSQL container and confirm the pgvector extension is active and ready for use.
