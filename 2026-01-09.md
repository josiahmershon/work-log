### Summary

Was in office. 
Got in touch with Trayvon for API credentials and ticket field info. 

Did some overall roadmapping and planning for the structure of the project. This pilot is essentially ready. Every obstacle that remains is a data ingestion / credential / API / etc issue, out of my control right now. I am very proactive in trying to get these things. But the underlying infrastructure is ready to go, a six-class process assistant for sales is working, it has all dummy data right now but again, that's out of my control, I've prototyped IT ticketing chatflows, maintenance chatflows, and a lot of others. I'll continue to refine and build as I can but there's not much further I can do until I get more info from other team members. 

The only two obstacles I foresee I cannot attack until I have it running with actual users and data. These issues are 1. Auth / session management for the users. 2. overall plan on either Master Intent Classifier or some other way to route users to the right assistant.
