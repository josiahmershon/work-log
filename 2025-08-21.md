Clock in: 8:26 a.m.
Clock out: 4:53 p.m.

### Summary

I continued remote analysis and research to diagnose the Layer 2 network failure on the GPU server's switch port.

I also conducted more research into data ingestion pipelines for the planned RAG project, mainly focusing on secure methods for connecting to internal document repositories.

I also mapped out the server rebuild process for the planned rebuild of the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, as this was also altered by the prior server issues. 

Network issue remains blocked. Server is on standby.
