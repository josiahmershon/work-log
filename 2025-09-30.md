### Summary

Added complete vLLM integration to existing RAG system. Implemented OpenAI client to connect to vLLM server running Qwen3-32B-AWQ model. Created generate_response_with_vllm() function that takes retrieved document chunks and user queries, formats them with system prompts for RAG behavior, and sends to vLLM for intelligent AI-generated responses instead of simple concatenated chunks.
Key Code Changes:
Added OpenAI client initialization with vLLM server configuration
Implemented context-aware AI response generation with proper system prompts
Added request ID tracking (8-character UUIDs) for log correlation and debugging
Created comprehensive error handling for vLLM communication
Added timing metrics for response generation (5-8 second response times)
Updated both /query and /query-precise endpoints to use vLLM instead of placeholder responses
Added /health/vllm endpoint to test vLLM server connectivity
System prompt engineering for RAG behavior with source citation requirements
Context formatting from retrieved chunks for optimal LLM input
Request/response logging with unique identifiers for debugging
Temperature and token limit configuration for consistent AI responses
