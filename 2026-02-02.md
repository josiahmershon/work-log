### Summary

Started planning final push. This week will be trying to set up some pilot users, setup some monitoring; and on friday I will try to come in the office to fix a few lingering problems with the URL and some other things. Ideally this push will be enough to get the AI assistant ready for a wider release.

I want to stop building in a vacuum. In the absence of good data to ingest; pilot users and their feedback will have the greatest impact on the quality of the AI assistant right now.
