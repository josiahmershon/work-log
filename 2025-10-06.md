### Summary

bootstrapped Chainlit UI and wired it to FastAPI backend


Initialized the frontend directory with Chainlit app (frontend/app.py) sending POST /query to backend.
Added environment-driven config: BACKEND_API_URL (default http://localhost:8001), BACKEND_ENDPOINT (/query), DEFAULT_USER_GROUPS (engineering,executives). These will just be passed from AD at runtime. 
Implemented basic UX: welcome banner, input handling, response + sources rendering.
Add frontend/requirements.txt with pinned deps (chainlit, httpx, pydantic, dotenv).
Document run instructions for dev (activate venv, run Chainlit; start backend via uvicorn).
Verify end-to-end query flow against FastAPI backend and pgvector DB.
Ops:
Create isolated venv at frontend/.venv and install requirements.

Test plan for tomorrow
Start backend on 8001; run Chainlit; ask questions; confirm responses and sources render.
