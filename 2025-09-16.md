### Summary

Implemented the initial application skeleton for the backend service using FastAPI.

Created a /health endpoint for system monitoring and a placeholder /query endpoint for the main RAG logic.

Successfully launched the web server using Uvicorn and resolved network configuration issues to make the API accessible over the local network via its IP address.

Confirmed the API is live by accessing the auto-generated documentation, completing the initial setup for the backend service.
