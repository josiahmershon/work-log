### Summary

In office. 
Switched to a Google Gemini API key for the beta. Everything works much better now. Spent all day prototyping SysAid ticket submission skill. 
Will hopefully finish today or tomorrow. Only things left to fix is branch + manager field mapping; right now it cant fill those fields. 
That can come later. For right now, the assistant can create tickets with plenty of information to be useful. Next comes pilot users, integration plans, and refinement.
