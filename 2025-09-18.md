### Summary

Today I focused on building out the RAG project's backend API to be much more robust and production-ready.

Scaffolded the core backend service using FastAPI. Implemented a robust configuration management system with Pydantic settings to securely handle database credentials and separate configuration from the application code.

Established a database connection pooling mechanism to ensure efficient and scalable database access, preventing the overhead of creating new connections for each API request.

Defined the API contract for the primary /query endpoint using Pydantic models. This provides automatic request validation, data serialization, and self-generating documentation for the API.

Implemented the foundational logic for the /query and /health endpoints. Performed end-to-end integration tests by sending requests to the running service, successfully validating the database connection, configuration loading, and the entire request/response data flow.
