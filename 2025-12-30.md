### Summary

Built a Question classifier routing user queries to specialized branches:
- Product Info (dummy data via Code node)
- Pricing (dummy data with volume/regional structure)
- Promotions (live Knowledge Base retrieval - WORKING)

Architecture:
Question Classifier → Branch-specific data retrieval → LLM synthesis → Answer

Next Steps: 
- Replace product/pricing Code nodes with Knowledge Base when UPC project completes
- Add Oracle DB connections for live pricing/inventory
- Expand to HR, IT, Operations branches using same pattern

Status: Sales pilot demo-ready. Promotions branch operational with real data.
