### Summary

I finalized my root cause analysis of the OS boot failure and coordinated the deployment of a new recovery plan.

I conducted extensive troubleshooting of the operating system installer, which was consistently failing to boot. This involved extensively editing kernel parameters, updating both the BIOS and the BMC, altering GRUB configuration, and more. None of this worked. 

I determined the root cause to be a firmware-level incompatibility between the server hardware and the Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS installation media. Or perhaps simply a problem with the USB stick or port. Therefore, the only logical next step is to make a new USB stick with the most recent version of Ubuntu Server LTS. Coordinated with Mark on this.

Made the new USB, plugged it in, and tried booting with the HWE kernel and the 'nomodeset' kernel parameter once again to bypass nouveau loading and trying to initialize the GPU. Once again the same problem was observed; the console displaying this message and then hanging indefinitely:

EFI stub: Loaded initrd from LINUX_EFI_INITRD_MEDIA_GUID device path
EFI stub: Measured initrd data into PCR 9

This has been the same problem exactly that has been observed every single time. I hope it is not a motherboard problem. 
Next steps for this problem will be researched tomorrow. I will likely simply drive down to the plant sometime this week to try to resolve the problem before school starts.
