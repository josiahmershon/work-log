### Summary

I created a general use chatflow app for Scoop, one that will be tailored to do basic things like draft emails, answer questions, search the web, retrieve the weather, and so on. I decided to structure it as a question intent classifier template that can route to the right tool as needed. 
I created skeleton nodes for each tool, web search, weather search, email / document drafting, calculations, and general conversation.
