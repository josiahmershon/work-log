### Summary

Integrated the placeholder get_relevant_chunks function into the main /query API endpoint to create a complete, testable workflow.

Conducted an end-to-end test of the backend service by sending a request from the FastAPI documentation page.

Successfully verified that a call to the /query endpoint correctly triggers the database retrieval logic, confirmed by the presence of the expected print statements in the server logs.

The API's foundational request/response loop is now fully implemented and validated, unblocking the next stage of development: integrating the actual SQL query logic.
