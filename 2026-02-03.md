### Summary

Created user account for John Gibbs for feedback. I also prototyped ideas for an HR assistant that can answer questions about HR policies and procedures. I planned out what the monitoring and logging stack would look like. Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus ideally. 
Will try to collect feedback and fix more issues as they arise as I introduce more pilot users into the system.
