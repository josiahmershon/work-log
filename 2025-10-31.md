### Summary

Working locally only - VPN issues remain unresolved heading into next week.

Removed duplicate `re` import from `sanitize_model_output` function. Cleaned up import statements.

Continued brainstorming AD group filtering logic and how `allowed_groups` will map to actual AD groups for future LDAP integration.

Local testing continues. Fixed five issues this week despite VPN limitations.

Need VPN fixed ASAP so I can see if any of my changes break in prod.
