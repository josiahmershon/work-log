Clock in: 8:30 a.m.
Clock out: 4:11 p.m.

### Summary

Today I configured internal DNS for scoop.bluebell.com:8085. I opted for direct routing instead of a reverse proxy to simplify the deployment while maintaining a clean URL structure.
This will route users to a signup screen where they can easily create an account and start using the AI assistant.
