Question Classifier
├─ Product Info → Knowledge Base retrieval (vectorized product specs, marketing materials, training docs)
├─ Pricing → HTTP Request to Oracle DB (live pricing data)
├─ Inventory → HTTP Request to Oracle DB (real-time stock levels)
├─ Promotions → Knowledge Base retrieval (current promo materials)
└─ Processes → Knowledge Base retrieval (SOPs, training materials from that UPC project)

Static/slow-changing data (product descriptions, allergens, processes) → Vector DB, fast retrieval, no API calls
Dynamic data (pricing, inventory) → Live Oracle queries, always current
Segmented knowledge bases mean better retrieval accuracy - sales KB doesn't pollute with HR policies, etc.
