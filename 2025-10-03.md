### Summary

Created new project plan for the next phase of the project, frontend development. This will involve a base Chainlit foundation / framework and then some manual edits / code to adopt Blue Bell's preferred style / branding. 
Ideally the Langchain orchestration and design phase will be executed in tandem with this (Chainlit is purpose-built to talk to Langchain) but that remains to be seen. 

Began outlining the frontend component structure and identifying which parts can be scaffolded automatically versus which will require custom work. Started drafting a list of required UI elements and their interactions. Also reviewed Chainlit documentation to ensure compatibility with our planned Langchain workflows.

Next steps: finalize the initial component list, set up the base Chainlit project, and begin implementing the first custom UI elements. Want to use ShadCN
