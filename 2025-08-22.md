### Summary

Followed up with Mark on the network outage. He moved the server to a new switch port (ge-1/0/8).

Mark performed a laptop test on the new port. SUCCESS. Confirmed the switch port, VLAN, and physical cabling were functional.

Diagnosis immediately pivoted back to a server-side issue. Ruled out network infrastructure as the cause.

Performed deep-dive diagnostics on the server's network stack to isolate the fault.

Ruled out firewall (iptables, ufw) and conflicting services (NetworkManager) as the cause.

Analyzed low-level driver output with ethtool and dmesg.

Root Cause Found: ethtool and kernel logs show the server's 10GbE NIC is only negotiating a 1Gbps link speed with the switch.

Attempt to manually force a 10Gbps link speed with ethtool failed, confirming a physical layer fault.

Final Diagnosis: The unhealthy physical link (caused by a bad/substandard Ethernet cable) is forcing a speed downgrade and causing the ARP failure.

Will replace cable on Monday.

Issue is blocked pending physical cable replacement.
