### Summary

I expanded the sales assistant prototype by building out the inventory availability workflow. This involved setting up simulated stock levels for distribution centers, calculating lead times, and integrating production scheduling data. After testing multi-region inventory queries and connecting them to the existing question classifier, the sales pilot is now capable of handling a full range of queries regarding product info, pricing, inventory, and promotions.
