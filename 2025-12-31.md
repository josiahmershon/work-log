### Summary

Created GitHub repo showcasing AI infrastructure architecture and deployment. Still waiting on the UPC project to complete before I can implement the product info and pricing branches. Also waiting on the Oracle DB connections to be set up for live pricing/inventory, and most importantly, on the sales data to be available for the knowledge base and more direction on what is wanted for the project as a whole.

**Deliverables:**
- Multi-branch workflow (product info, pricing, promotions)
- Live knowledge base integration for promotions
- Public documentation repo: github.com/josiahmershon/blue-bell-ai-infrastructure
