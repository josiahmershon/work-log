### Summary

Will not be able to come into office tomorrow. Schedule got a little crazy. 
Started honing eventual setup script. Script would need to be run by IT, and would install the necessary dependencies, clone the repo, and set up the environment variables. Likely will need some supplemental manual setup, especially on the pilot users' machines before refinement can commence. 
Also communicated with project manager on status of data ingestion. Now that UPC project is wrapping up, this can start.
