## Work Log Entry: 2025-08-27

Clock in: 12:30 p.m.
Clock out: 5:20 p.m.

### Summary

Performed a full software reset of the server's network stack to eliminate all possible configuration errors.

Purged all network management packages.

Attempted to configure the network with low-level tools (iproute2) and the classic /etc/network/interfaces.

All software-based configuration attempts failed to resolve the issue.

Final Diagnosis: Fault is definitively isolated to the server's onboard 10GbE NIC. The NIC has a hardware fault that prevents proper speed negotiation and traffic processing.

Resolution Plan: Will go on-site Friday (Aug 29) to install a new PCIe network card to bypass the faulty onboard NIC. Will proceed with the OS installation tomorrow (Aug 28) in preparation.
