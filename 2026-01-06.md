### Summary

I kept working on the SysAid API integration today. I built a code node that can submit tickets automatically and handle any errors that pop up. I also planned to get in touch with Trayvon to get our API credentials and clarify which ticket fields we need for the Blue Bell setup. I've been designing the logic to pull info out of conversations and turn it into the right format for the API.

It will be much more complicated than anticipated to do this. I need to do more research and planning before I can proceed. I also need more info from other team members to proceed. Switching gears to sales assistant.
