### Summary

Initiated the on-prem RAG project by creating the main Git repository and establishing the foundational directory structure for the backend and frontend services.

Configured the initial .gitignore file to exclude common Python artifacts and local environment files to ensure a clean version control history.

Made the initial commit, officially placing the project under version control and preparing the workspace for a phased development start tomorrow.
