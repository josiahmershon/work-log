### Summary

Today I analyzed SysAid field requirements for comprehensive ticket submission. I identified required fields including Impact, Request User, and User Manager beyond basic ticket data. I evaluated field mapping strategies and API value formats for custom urgency levels. I documented field structure for future implementation when additional user data collection is integrated into conversational flow.
